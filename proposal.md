 The goal of our 'Pet Store App' is to allow owners to keep track of pet medical
 records, and other pertinent information that would allow them to better care
 for their pets. We noticed a need for users to have access to digital tracking
 of pet health and activities, and we are developing an app
 that will serve this underserved market.
